---

### \[1\]
Write an output iterator, `Sink`, that doesn’t actually write anywhere. When can Sink be useful?\
\
File(s): [`_`](./)

### \[2\]
(D2) Implement `reverse_iterator` (§33.2.1).\
\
File(s): [`_`](./)

### \[3]
(D1.5) Implement `ostream_iterator` (§38.5).\
\
File(s): [`_`](./)

### \[4\]
(D2) Implement istream_iterator (§38.5).\
\
File(s): [`_`](./)

### \[5\]
(D2.5) Design, implement, and test a run-time range-checked random-access iterator `Checked_iter`.\
\
File(s): [`_`](./)

### \[6\]
(D2) Design and implement a handle class that can act as a proxy for a container by providing a complete container interface to its users. Its implementation should consist of a pointer to a container plus implementations of container operations that do range checking.\
