### \[16\]
(D3.5) Implement a version of a Reversi/Othello board game. Each player can be either a human or the computer. Focus on getting the program correct and (then) getting the computer player "smart" enough to be worth playing against.\

### \[17\]
(D3) Improve the user interface of the game from ยงX.22\[16\].\

### \[18\]
(D3) Define a graphical object class with a plausible set of operations to serve as a common base class for a library of graphical objects; look at a graphics library to see what operations were supplied there. Define a database object class with a plausible set of operations to serve as a common base class for objects stored as sequences of fields in a database; look at a database library to see what operations were supplied there. Define a graphical database object with and without the use of multiple inheritance and discuss the relative merits of the two solutions.\

### \[19\]
(D2.5) Draw a plausible memory layout for a `Radio` as defined in ยง21.3.4. Explain how a virtual function call could be implemented.\

### \[20\]
(D2.5) Draw a plausible memory layout for a `Radio` as defined in ยง22.2.2. Explain how a virtual function call could be implemented.\
\
File(s): [`_`](./)

### \[21\]
(D2) Assume that the type-checking rules for arguments were relaxed in a way similar to the relaxation for return types so that a function taking a `Derived*` could override a function taking a `Base*`. Then write a program that would corrupt an object of class `Derived` without using a cast. Describe a safe relaxation of the overriding rules for argument types.\
