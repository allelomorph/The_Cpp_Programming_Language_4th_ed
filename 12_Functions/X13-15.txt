// #define PI = 3.141593;
// No assignment operator is needed:
#define PI 3.141593;
// However, it would be much better to use a constexpr to observe scope and be
//   useful to other constexpr

// #define MAX(a,b) a>b?a:b
// Function-type macros can have side effects, and cause syntax errors. Rigorous
//   use of parentheses can help prevent double evaluation, but there still can
//   be other side effects.
// #define MAX(a,b) ( ((a) > (b)) ? (a) : (b) )

// #define fac(a) (a)*fac((a)âˆ’1)
// Recursive macros seem to be generally prohibited by the C and C++ standards,
//   and in many cases will only expand once, not recursively, see:
