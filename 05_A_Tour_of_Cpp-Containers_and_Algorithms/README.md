### \[1\] When first reading this chapter, keep a record of information that was new or surprising to
you. Later, use that list to focus your further studies.

File(s): [``](./)

### \[2\] (D1) List five standard-library containers.

File(s): [``](./)

### \[3\] (D1) List five standard-library algorithms.

File(s): [``](./)

### \[4\] (D1) List five standard-library headers.

File(s): [``](./)

### \[5\] (D1.5) Write a program that reads a name (a `string`) and an age (an `int`) from the standard input stream `cin`. Then output a message including the name and age to the standard output stream `cout`.

File(s): [``](./)\
Compiled: ``

### \[6\] (D1.5) Redo §X.5[5], storing several (name, age) pairs in a class. Doing the reading and writing using your own `>>` and `<<` operators.

File(s): [``](./)\
Compiled: ``

### \[7\] (D2) Initialize a `vector<int>` with the elements `5`, `9`, `−1`, `200`, and `0`. Print it. Sort it, and print it again.

File(s): [``](./)\
Compiled: ``

### \[8\] (D1) Repeat §X.5\[7\] with a `vector<string>` initialized with `"Kant"`, `"Plato"`, `"Aristotle"`, `"Kierkegard"`, and `"Hume"`.

File(s): [``](./)\
Compiled: ``

### \[9\] (D1) Open a file for writing (as an `ofstream`) and write a few hundred integers to it.

File(s): [``](./)\
Compiled: ``

### \[10\] (D1) Open the file of integers from §X.5\[9\] for reading (as an `ifstream`) and read it.
