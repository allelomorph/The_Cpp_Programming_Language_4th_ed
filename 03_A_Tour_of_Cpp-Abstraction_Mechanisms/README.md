# X.4 A Tour of C++: Abstraction Mechanisms

## Environment
- Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS
- g++ (Ubuntu 9.3.0-17ubuntu1~20.04) 9.3.0

## Key
- DX: Stroustrup difficulty rating (logorithmic: D1 = ~10 minutes, D2 = ~1 hour, D3 = ~1 day)

## [`examples/`](./examples/)
Annotated code examples modified from Stroustrup and other sources to test the concepts introduced in the chapter. Generally all in one file per book section, for convenience's sake, even as best practice would often be to create separate translation units.

Exercises for this chapter skipped. Please see [`examples/`](./examples/) for tests/study notes.
